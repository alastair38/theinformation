If you are using an Android tablet, the following guidance will help you to get the best video meeting experience.


## Audio

### Using an external microphone

Plug a tablet / smartphone specific microphone into the headphone jack on your device or use a DSLR microphone with a  trs to trrs adapter

Regardless of the microphone you are using, the further away the mic is from the people talking, the lower the audio quality will be, so consider a microphone with a decent length cable or an extension cable.

### Using external speakers

As with built-in microphones, built-in device speakers are often poor and turning up the volume to better hear other groups in the meeting may produce a tinny, distorted sound. External speakers, whether plug in or Bluetooth will help to give you a more audible meeting.

## Screen size

### Wired connection to a TV

If you’re tablet has an HDMI port (usually a mini) you should be able to connect it to the TV using a similar process to above - although you will need a mini to full size HDMI cable in this instance.

Once you have connected your tablet, use the TV remote to select the ‘Source’ which corresponds to where you the laptop plugged into (TVs normally have between 5 and 10 sources - this is basically the number of outlets on a TV that you can plug stuff into - so it won’t take too long if you click through them until you see your laptop screen showing on the TV)

You should now be able to view the video meeting on your TV screen.

Make sure that you place your device on a similar level to the TV and do not obscure the device camera as this will still be used to transmit video of you to other meeting attendees.

### Wirelessly connecting to a TV

A common option for connecting devices wirelessly to a TV is using Chromecast, which is a small ‘dongle’ that plugs into an HDMI outlet on your TV. Please note that a Chromecast needs power to work, so you can either plug its power cable into a USB outlet on your TV (if it has one) or you can plug it in directly to a plug socket (using the sort of USB adapter plugs that most people use when charging their phones)

You also need to download the Google Home app for your mobile device in order to connect the Chromecast (make sure the Chromecast is plugged in, the TV is on and you have selected the corresponding ‘Source’)  to your WiFi network.

Once Chromecast is configured you can ‘cast’ your mobile device to the TV so you will see everything from your mobile screen on the larger screen.  You can also cast your laptop screen using the Chrome web browser.

Some modern TVs also come with a built-in wireless display option that can let you connect wirelessly to PCs / laptops running Windows 10 (and some tablets or phones) without having to use a Chromecast. This can be hit or miss and should not be relied upon unless you have previously tried it out with the devices you will be using for the video meeting.
