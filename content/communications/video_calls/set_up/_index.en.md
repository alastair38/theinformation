These 'Prerequisites' will allow you to connect to a video meeting, but this is just half the battle for getting a worthwhile experience.

## Meeting Feng Shui

Remember, the other groups joining a meeting need to be able to see and hear you clearly. Also, everyone in your own group needs to be able to comfortably see and hear the other groups joining the meeting. With this in mind

1. If you can, choose rooms for your meetings that are NOT prone to echoes.

2. Think about where your plug sockets are in the room, if you need any power

3. Make sure the device you are using to connect to the meeting is positioned in such a place to get all your lovely faces on the camera

4. Make sure the device you are viewing the other groups connecting to the meeting on is larger enough for you to see these groups clearly

If you need to include a wide area of the room in your meeting, ideally the device hosting the meeting should be in the corner of the room pointing diagonally across the scene.
The main drawback of trying to include a wide scene in your meeting is that the device camera will be further away from the subject.  Not only will this reduce size of people in the scene, but also potential ‘cosiness’.  Also, if you are using the device microphone for audio, this will similarly be further away from the action, so reducing sound quality.
