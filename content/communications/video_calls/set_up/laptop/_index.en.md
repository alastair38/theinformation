If you are using a laptop, the following guidance will help you to get the best video meeting experience.

## Video

### Use an external webcam

The built-in webcam on your laptop is probably adequate, but no better.  So you should consider attaching an external webcam, such as the Logitech c920.  Not only will this give you a better image and audio (if you do not use a separate microphone), an external webcam can be more flexibly positioned as it is only attached to your laptop by a wire

## Audio

### Using an external microphone

The sound from most devices that can easily connect to a video meeting is poor. The built-in microphones are generally designed to pick up sound from nearby and so capturing a number of people talking from further away will introduce echo and background hiss.  External microphones can significantly improve the quality of the sound from your ‘side’ of the meeting - so far, a set up using a video H1 record with a Rode Videomicro has worked very well.  However, this is a set up used as it was available and is not specifically designed for use with laptops, PCs etc.  A better option would be to use a plug-in USB microphone marketed for use in video calling / podcasting.

Regardless of the microphone you are using, the further away the mic is from the people talking, the lower the audio quality will be, so consider a microphone with a decent length cable.

### Use external speakers

As with built-in microphones, built-in device speakers are often poor and turning up the volume to better hear other groups in the meeting may produce a tinny, distorted sound. External speakers, whether plug in or Bluetooth will help to give you a more audible meeting.

## Increasing the screen size

### Wired connection to a TV

Modern laptops can be connected to most modern TVs using an HDMI cable

Apple laptops can be connected directly using an HDMI cable (if they have an HDMI port) or by using Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Cable adapter and then connecting this to the TV with an HDMI cable.

Older laptops with HDMI ports can usually be connected using a VGA cable.

You should now be able to view the video meeting on your TV screen.

Make sure that you place your laptop on a similar level to the TV and do not obscure the laptop webcam as this will still be used to transmit video of you to other meeting attendees.

### Wirelessly connecting to a TV

A common option for connecting devices wirelessly to a TV is using Chromecast, which is a small ‘dongle’ that plugs into an HDMI outlet on your TV. Please note that a Chromecast needs power to work, so you can either plug its power cable into a USB outlet on your TV (if it has one) or you can plug it in directly to a plug socket (using the sort of USB adapter plugs that most people use when charging their phones)

You also need to download the Google Home app for your mobile device in order to connect the Chromecast (make sure the Chromecast is plugged in, the TV is on and you have selected the corresponding ‘Source’)  to your WiFi network.

Once Chromecast is configured you can ‘cast’ your mobile device to the TV so you will see everything from your mobile screen on the larger screen.  You can also cast your laptop screen using the Chrome web browser.

Some modern TVs also come with a built-in wireless display option that can let you connect wirelessly to PCs / laptops running Windows 10 (and some tablets or phones) without having to use a Chromecast. This can be hit or miss and should not be relied upon unless you have previously tried it out with the devices you will be using for the video meeting.
