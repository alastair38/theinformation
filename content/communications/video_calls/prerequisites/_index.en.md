Before you join a video call or video meeting you will need three things:

* internet access
* a device to connect to the internet
* a video calling app

## Accessing the Internet

The best option is to connect to a broadband internet connection that you might have a home or work. You can does this either via WiFi or directly using an ethernet cable


If broadband is not available or is too slow, the second option is to connect to the internet via a mobile network. This is how mobile phones (and some tablets) access the internet when you’re out and about.

Bear in mind that your mobile phone contract may limit the amount of internet data you can use each month, so check this before joining a video meeting while using a mobile network or using your phone as a hotspot. Also, your phone battery will drain quicker if being used in this way.

Using a mobile network, you can connect directly to a meeting using your mobile phone or tablet (if it is has this functionality) once you have installed the required video calling app. Alternatively, many modern mobile phones let you share their mobile network connection by creating something known as a ‘hotspot’ (also known as internet tethering). This essentially means the mobile phone creates a WiFi network to which other nearby devices can connect. This is particularly useful if you have a laptop that you wish to use to join a meeting as you can turn your phone into a hotspot and then connect your laptop to this, as if you were connecting to a normal WiFi network.

## Devices you can use

Providing they can connect to the internet, you can use any of the following devices to join a video calling meeting : PC or laptop; (both require video calling to be downloaded - this is a quick and simple process. Your PC or laptop will also require a webcam); Mobile phone or tablet (there are apps for Android phones and tablets, as well as ones for iPhones / iPads). These apps need to be installed in order to join a meeting

## Video calling apps

There are dozens of apps that you can use to make video calls. We won't go through all of them, but listed below you will find a number of different installation guides for popular video meeting services that we feel are the best suited.

### Zoom installation

If you are using a PC or Laptop you can download the program you require to join a meeting by going to the Zoom website by clicking on the button below and clicking on the ‘Download’ link below the ‘Zoom Client for Meeting’ heading. If you haven’t done this before a meeting starts, the program will automatically download and install when you go to join the meeting.
