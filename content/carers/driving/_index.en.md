People with dementia are obliged to tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency (DVLA) if they wish to continue driving after they are diagnosed with
dementia. Anyone who fails to disclose a medical condition that might affect their
driving could be liable to a Â£1,000 fine. If they fail to disclose and are involved in
an accident, they might also be liable to prosecution.
