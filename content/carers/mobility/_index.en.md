The Blue Badge is awarded based on physical mobility issues, for a fee of around
£20. It is valid for a period of around three years. However, some Local Authorities
are now offering a “cognitive impairment” Blue Badge. Validity is limited to a year.

The cognitive process of getting in and out of a car can be quite complex for
someone with dementia. Turn circles are available to place on car seats as aids
to help someone swing their legs into the car. The downside is that they don’t
seem to work very well. An easier solution might be a sturdy black bin liner.

Motability cars are based on physical need but are only available to people under
the age of 65 years.

Wheelchairs are free. Ask your GP for a referral.
