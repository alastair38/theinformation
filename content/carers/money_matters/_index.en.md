## Attendance Allowance

Attendance Allowance is a non-means tested benefit paid to people aged 65 or
over, based on their needs. Having a diagnosis of dementia does not automatically
qualify someone for Attendance Allowance. Attendance Allowance is paid at two
rates: £55 per week and £83 per week for those whose needs are more severe. Age
Scotland has an excellent booklet that explains eligibility criteria.

* To claim: you can download Attendance Allowance forms and complete them
yourself or you might prefer to contact the Citizen’s Advice Bureau or your local
Carers Centre for assistance.

* Please remember that Attendance Allowance is paid per person, not per
household. If you are caring for someone with dementia, but you also have
health problems for which you need support and you are aged 65 or older, you
might be entitled to claim Attendance Allowance in your own right.

## Carers Allowance
Carers Allowance is paid at a rate of £62 per week to carers of people who already
receive Personal Independence Payment, Disability Living Allowance or Attendance
Allowance. If the person for whom you care does not receive any benefits, you
cannot claim Carers Allowance. Carers who earn over £110 a week or who receive a
state pension are not awarded Carers Allowance. If you claim, the Department for
Work and Pensions might reduce the sum awarded to the person you care for.

## Disability Living Allowance (DLA)/Personal Independence Payment (PIP)

DLA and PIP are benefits that are paid to people with dementia who are under the
age of 65 years. PIP took over from DLA but, like DLA, the award is based on an
assessment of need rather than a diagnosis. If you are caring for someone with
early onset dementia, you need to consider claiming PIP. Citizens Advice Bureaux,
Carers Centres, and Dementia Resource Centres can advise.

## Council Tax Rebates

Most Local Authorities offer Council Tax Rebates for anyone living with ‘severe
mental impairment’.

* Depending on the Local Authority, the rebate might be 100% for sole occupancy
or 25-50% rebate for two people in the same household where one has a severe
mental impairment. If there are more than two people living in the household,
it is likely that there will be no reduction in Council Tax.

* If you have had to make substantial alterations to your house because you are
caring for someone who is also physically disabled, you might also be entitled
to a reduction in Council Tax.

## Home Energy

Consider checking your tariff to ensure that you have the best rate. If you are
spending more time indoors and at home, or you are doing more laundry, it is
surprising how costs can increase.
