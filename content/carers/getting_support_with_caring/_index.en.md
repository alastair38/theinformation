## Carer Assessment/Carer Support Plan

Currently, Local Authorities have a duty to assess a carer’s ability to care through
an assessment and have the power to provide support where necessary. NHS
Boards can also be required to publish a Carer Information Strategy setting out
how carers will be informed on their right to request an assessment.

The Carers (Scotland) Act 2016 will come into being on 1 April 2018. The
Act is designed to support the health and wellbeing of carers by placing a duty
on Local Authorities to provide support for carers. It will replace the current
assessment with an Adult Carer Support Plan which will identify care needs and
personal outcomes.

The Adult Carer Support Plan will include information about:

* the personal circumstances of the carer
* the nature and extent of the care provided
* the impact on the carer’s day to day life and wellbeing
* the extent the carer is able and willing to provide care
* the carer’s personal outcomes and support needs
* the available support in the carer’s local area
* whether support should be a break from caring
* whether the support meets the local eligibility criteria

Each Local Authority will require to have an information and advice service
for carers which should provide them with information and advice to carers
on emergency and future care planning, advocacy and carers’ rights (as well
as income maximisation, education and training, health and wellbeing, and
bereavement support for carers).

Currently, Integrated Health and Social Care Partnerships are preparing the way for
the implementation of the Act.

Until then, all carers have the right to a carer assessment, which can be requested
from your GP or social worker if the person you care for is receiving social care.

## Self Directed Support (SDS)

SDS is a new approach to social care that gives you and your family choice about
where, when and how you are supported by working out a budget that you use to
buy the services that you need.

To get SDS, Social Services will assess the needs of the person you care for. If
you can keep a record of daily needs or give examples of how you might use
the support of a personal assistant, it will help Social Services construct a more
realistic budget.

SDS encompasses four options:
* Option One: Direct Payment (using your budget to employ a Personal Assistant
directly). This is the most cost effective option but requires you to recruit and
manage care input.
* Option Two: Individual Service Fund. Social Services hold your Fund and you
instruct them on what to book and whom to pay.
* Option Three: Arranged Service. Social Services organise and pay for the
support but consult you.
* Option Four: Combined Support. A combination of any, or all, of the above.,
Respect, Responsibility

## SDS and the 3 Rs Project (Rights, Respect, Responsibility)

This is a new legal rights project, set up in 2017 and run by MECOPP. It assists
individuals with social care support needs to realise new rights and entitlements
conferred on them by the **Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act
2013**. Funded in part by the Life Changes Trust, the project provides specialist
support to people with dementia and carers.

The Project can provide advice and information on your legal rights under SDS,
human rights and equalities legislation, undertake casework on your behalf to
support resolution of more complex issues, and refer you to legal organisations
if resolution cannot be reached. You can self-refer directly, and a third sector
organisation supporting you as an individual can also refer, anywhere in Scotland.
You do not have to be a member of a minority ethnic community to access the
project.

## Companionship Care

Attendance Allowance, or Personal Independence Payment benefits, might give
you the option of booking one to three hours of companionship care from an
agency such as Crossroads.
