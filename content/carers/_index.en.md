The carers checklist (*Laura's List*) was originally written by Katharyn Barnett who, following her mother's dementia diagnosis in 1995, learned to identify the right support so that she could access it as and when needed.

> This list is not exhaustive but it’s a checklist that I put together in the hope that
it would provide a starting point. Because once you have the essentials in place,
once you know where to go to get help if and when you need it, you can begin to do
dementia your way, rather than let an illness dictate your life - **Katharyn Barnett**

Without the work of people like Katharyn, these resources would not exist, so take it and build on it to make *Laura’s List* into your personalised directory of care.

And remember, pass the goodwill forward!
