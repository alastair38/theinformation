## Flexible Working

As a carer, you have the right to ask your employer for unpaid leave to accompany
a dependent to medical appointments and to request flexible working hours.
The employer can refuse, but many would prefer to try to accommodate a long
standing and experienced employee rather than recruit a replacement.
