## Memory boxes and albums

As a carer, you are the person who knows all the likes, dislikes and funny family stories that make the person you care for unique. Start a family album or memory box of all the good times and encourage others to contribute. It provides a life-story in pictures that people with dementia can share – and one that is often fascinating for younger members of the family!

## The ‘twiddlemuff’

For people living with dementia who have restless fingers and cold hands.

## Day centre activities

If you are struggling with your caring commitments, look at the day centre activities for people with dementia available close to you, if the person you care for is happy to give them a try. There is often a range of activities on offer. Groups are aimed primarily at 65 years+ but not exclusively so.

There are Memory Groups, Musical Reminiscence and Sporting Groups (e.g. Football, Shinty, Bowling, etc). There are Dementia Walks, art classes and musical and choral groups that offer a caring and safe environment for the person with
dementia so that you, the carer, can take a break.

In most instances, you can either self-refer, or ask for a referral from Social Services, Carers Centres or your Community Psychiatric Nurse. Depending on circumstances, you might be able to secure a place free of charge or you might have to pay a contribution to the cost.

Try to keep yourself ‘connected’ too. Ask your local Carers Centre or Local Authority about a Carer’s Card that might get you concessions, for example, reduced membership fees of leisure centres or discounts on theatre tickets. If you
don’t ask, you don’t get! It isn’t demeaning to ask for discounts and you might pave the way for other carers.
