## Online support

If you struggle to get out of the house because of your caring commitment, you might need online support. <a href="https://forum.alzheimers.org.uk/">**Talking Point** <i class='fa fa-external-link'></i></a>, Alzheimer’s Society’s online community for anyone affected by dementia, is an excellent online resource for carers. Carers register anonymously to participate in an online forum for practical advice from carers on anything and everything. There are also Factsheets to inform carers about different aspects of dementia.

## Admiral Nurse Dementia Helpline

The <a href="https://www.dementiauk.org/get-support/admiral-nurse-dementia-helpline/">**Admiral Nurse Dementia Helpline** <i class='fa fa-external-link'></i></a> offers specialist practical and emotional advice to families caring for someone with dementia by phone or email.

The helpline is also available to people with a diagnosis of dementia, those worried about their memory or the memory of a loved one, and professionals working in dementia care.

The Dementia Helpline number is 0800 888 6678 or you can email them at <a href="mailto:helpline@dementiauk.org">helpline@dementiauk.org</a>. Its normal opening hours are 9am to 9pm from Monday to Friday and 9am to 5pm on Saturdays and Sundays.

Currently in Scotland, Admiral Nurses provide a service in Glasgow - the Glasgow Admiral Nurse Service with BUPA. BUPA work with people living with dementia within BUPA care homes and their carers. Community services, dependent on resources, may be available for non BUPA clients. To contact the Glasgow service directly, call 0141 880 8040. See https://www.dementiauk.org/get-support/find-an-admiral-nurse/.

## Peer to Peer Resources

The Life Changes Trust has provided funding to carers of someone with dementia, as well as people with dementia, to produce their own resources to raise awareness of a particular issue, offer advice or share learning that will help others (other
people with dementia and/or carers).
