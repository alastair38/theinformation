Pain, like depression, is often untreated in dementia but it need not be. As a carer, you can probably identify pain signals very easily. Palliative care in the community is via GP referral.

Palliative care is NOT solely for End of Life Care (EOLC). Palliative care was redefined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be pain relief for anyone suffering with a long term, degenerative condition.
