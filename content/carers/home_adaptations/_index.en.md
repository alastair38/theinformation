## Alterations

Grab rails are free via Social Services and Occupational Therapy.

Many Local Authorities will help to part fund wet rooms, but they will not finance
chair lifts or rise and recline chairs for people with dementia or for people with
Parkinsonâ€™s related dementia.

## Community alarms (if falls are an issue)

Some Local Authorities do not charge for Community Alarms if there is a diagnosis
of dementia, but some do charge. Social Services might also offer Buddi Trackers
(a locator device worn on a lanyard, as a watch or like a mobile phone that enables
carers to find people who are inclined to wander), perimeter alarms and internal
alarms.

## Moving and handling

Take care of your back if, for example, you assist someone in and out of the bath
or bed. Some Occupational Therapists or nurses will come out to the house to give
carers tips on safe moving and handling. A slide sheet (a length of nylon material
folded back on itself) is a very useful aid if you need to move someone up or down
the bed. (Remember to remove it after using!).
